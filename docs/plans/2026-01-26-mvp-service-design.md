# $950 MVP Service — Landing Page & Go-to-Market Design

## Overview

A landing page and go-to-market strategy for an MVP building service targeting non-technical founders, validation-focused startups, and busy operators (coaches, consultants, SMBs). Price point: $950 starting.

## Business Model

- **Service:** MVP development for web, mobile, and AI solutions
- **Price:** $950 flat starting point
- **Delivery:** Agency model with team/contractors, built quickly using Claude Code
- **Strategy:** Land-and-expand — MVP proves value, upsell to full application

## Value Proposition

"AI tools let anyone generate code. We bring the product thinking, architecture decisions, and business acumen that turn your idea into something that works — and scales. $950 to start."

### Differentiators

- **Honesty:** Acknowledge DIY tools exist, position expertise as the value layer
- **Architecture that scales:** MVPs built to grow, not throw away
- **Product strategy:** Help decide *what* to build, not just *how*
- **Market validation lens:** Experience seeing what works and what flops
- **Full journey partner:** Invested in success beyond the MVP

## MVP Offerings ($950)

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Web App** | 1-2 core features, user auth, clean database. Ready for demos or testing. |
| **AI Chatbot** | RAG-powered assistant trained on client's content for support or guidance. |
| **Voice Agent** | Conversational AI for one use case (bookings, support, lead qualification). |
| **Content Automation** | Pipeline for auto-generating social posts, emails, or blog drafts. |

## Landing Page Design (AIDA Framework)

### Section 1: Attention (Hero)

**Headline:**
"Yes, AI can build your MVP. We make sure it's worth building."

**Subheadline:**
"$950 — A scalable, investor-ready MVP built by people who've seen what succeeds and what flops."

**Supporting text:**
"Tools like Claude and Lovable let anyone generate code. But code isn't a product. We bring the business acumen, architecture decisions, and product thinking that turns your idea into something that actually works — and grows."

**CTA Button:**
"Submit Your Idea — $950 →"

**Micro-copy:**
"Tell us what you're building. We'll reply within 12 hours with a few questions, then start building."

**Trust elements:**
- "50+ MVPs launched"
- Industry badges from portfolio
- "Web • Mobile • AI Agents • Voice • Automation"

### Section 2: Interest (What You Get)

**Headline:**
"What $950 Gets You"

**Four offering cards:**

1. **Web App MVP** — "A working app with 1-2 core features, user auth, and a clean database structure. Ready to demo to investors or test with real users."

2. **AI Assistant / Chatbot** — "A custom AI trained on your content — answers questions, handles support, or guides users. Powered by RAG so it actually knows your stuff."

3. **Voice Agent** — "Conversational AI that talks to your customers — for bookings, support, or lead qualification. One focused use case, fully functional."

4. **Content Automation** — "Auto-generate social posts, emails, blog drafts, or marketing copy from your inputs. Set up once, produce endlessly."

**Honesty differentiator block:**

**"Why not just use AI tools yourself?"**

"You could. And for some people, that's the right call. But here's what we've learned building 50+ MVPs:

- **Code isn't the hard part anymore** — knowing what to build is.
- **Most MVPs fail because of bad product decisions**, not bad code.
- **Scaling a prototype is painful** if the foundation is wrong.

We don't just build. We advise. We challenge your assumptions. We help you avoid the mistakes we've seen sink other founders."

### Section 3: Desire (Social Proof)

**Headline:**
"Built to Validate. Architected to Scale."

**Portfolio examples:**

1. **FinTech Dashboard MVP** — "A founder needed to demo a financial analytics tool to investors. We built a working dashboard with real-time data visualization in 5 days. They raised their seed round 3 weeks later."

2. **On-Demand Service App** — "A small business owner wanted to test if customers would book through an app. MVP launched, 200 bookings in the first month. Now in development for the full platform."

3. **Customer Support AI for E-commerce** — "A store owner was drowning in repetitive questions. We built a RAG-powered assistant trained on their product catalog. Support tickets dropped 40%."

4. **Content Engine for a Coach** — "A business coach needed consistent social content but hated writing. We built a pipeline that turns voice notes into LinkedIn posts, emails, and tweets."

**Testimonial (placeholder):**
> "I thought I needed $20K and three months. [YourMVP] got me a working prototype for $950 in a week. I validated my idea before burning through my savings."
> — *Founder*

**Scale teaser:**

**"And when you're ready to grow..."**
"Your $950 MVP isn't throwaway code. It's built on a foundation that scales. When you're ready for the full product — more features, integrations, mobile apps, enterprise — we're already familiar with your vision. Same team. No re-explaining. No starting over."

### Section 4: Action (Form)

**Headline:**
"Ready to Build? Tell Us Your Idea."

**Subtext:**
"No calls. No lengthy proposals. Just tell us what you're thinking, and we'll reply within 12 hours."

**Below form:**

- "No commitment until you say go."
- "Payment only after we align on scope."

**FAQ:**

- **"What if my idea is too complex for $950?"** — "We'll tell you. Some ideas need a $950 MVP to validate first. Others need more. We'll be honest about which yours is."
- **"How long does it take?"** — "Most MVPs are delivered within 5-10 days depending on complexity."
- **"What tech do you use?"** — "Modern, scalable stack — React, Next.js, Python, cloud infrastructure. Built to grow with you."
