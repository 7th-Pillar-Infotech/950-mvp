TITLE: Doing free prototypes for founders - 10 spots/day, no strings

---

So here's the deal.

I've been building MVPs for startups for like 10 years now. And the thing that kills me? Watching founders disappear for 6 months to build something, only to find out nobody actually wants it. Seen it happen way too many times.

Anyway, I had this idea last week. What if I just... made prototypes for people? For free? Like actual clickable stuff, not some figma mockup.

Started doing it. Honestly it's been pretty fun.

Here's what I'm handing over:
- Real React code, 3-5 screens that actually click around
- Landing page so you can gauge interest
- Hosted on a real URL you can send to people
- Done in a day or two

No payment info, no "free trial" bs. Just tell me what you're building and I'll make it.

Why tho? I mean yeah it feeds into our paid stuff ($950 full MVPs) but whatever. Worst case you get a free prototype and ghost me. I'm fine with that lol.

Only thing is I'm capping it at 10/day because otherwise I'll drown. There's a quick chat thing on the site where you describe your idea and we go from there.

If this sounds useful cool. If not, no worries. Just thought I'd throw it out here.
